DESCRIPTION :

Overview - 

The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a Python-based security project focused on demonstrating two essential techniques used in ethical hacking and network assessments: Brute Force Attacks and Port Scanning. This toolkit was designed to offer students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and ethical hackers a hands-on, educational resource to understand how basic attack vectors are developed and used in penetration testing.

While full-scale vulnerability assessment tools exist in the industry, this lightweight and script-based toolkit focuses on teaching the foundational logic behind attack methods in a controlled and responsible way. The simplicity of the toolkit makes it ideal for academic projects, training labs, personal experimentation, and foundational security research.

Purpose -

This toolkit serves as a practical guide to two fundamental areas of penetration testing:

Port Scanning is the first step in most attacks or audits. It helps identify which services are exposed and listening on a network. By knowing which ports are open, a tester can determine what services might be vulnerable.

Brute Force Attacks simulate password guessing techniques used to exploit weak login credentials on web-based login forms. This is an essential skill in learning how authentication systems can be bypassed if not properly secured.

This project allows users to manually engage with each concept through Python, giving insight into how penetration testing tools operate under the hood.

Technologies Used -

Python 3.x

socket – for TCP connections in the port scanner

requests – for sending HTTP POST requests in the brute force tool

sys, time, os – for script control and response handling

Optional: argparse for adding command-line flexibility

How to Use -

Clone or download this repository.

Open the script using Python IDLE or any terminal-based environment.

For the Port Scanner:

Input the target IP address or domain.

Choose port range or use default list.

View the scan results showing open or closed ports.

For the Brute Force Tool:

Input the target login URL.

Provide the path to your username/password wordlist.

Monitor attempts and check if valid credentials are found.

Use Cases -

Security education and training in password security and network scanning

Academic projects or lab exercises in ethical hacking courses

Demonstration of real-world attack techniques in a safe and responsible environment

Development of Python skills through security-focused programming
